## Welcome to my blog!

I will start the dev-blog posts soon and I am obligated to create a welcome post to familiarize with the pipeline. I am new to blog posts but I will do my best.
To know more about the blog, visit the [About](https://christt105.github.io/dev-blog/about/) section and to know more about me and my projects check out my website [christt105.github.io](https://christt105.github.io/).

I have made the blog with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and if you are interested in building your own blog, just follow the guidelines of [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), it is super easy to have your blog in a few minutes.
